Tested on Windows, soon to be tested on Linux, need volunteer for MacOS.

---------Anaconda--------------------------------
First we must install the Anaconda Distribution. This is available for 
Windows, MacOS, and Linux. Since Python 2 no longer is being supported and is
considered legacy, we will install the Python 3 version of Anaconda.

Step 1: Navigating to the Website and Clicking Things

    Copy and paste the following URL into your browser's address bar:
    https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section

    When the page loads you should see a "Download" button under text reading 
    "Python 3.7 version". Click on this download button.

    An executable named something like "Anaconda3-5.3.1-Windows-x86_64.exe" should
    be downloaded (the name and extension will be slightly different for MacOS and
    Linux, but will begin with "Anaconda3"). This is the installer we will use in 
    the next step.

Step 2: Running the Installer

    Run the installer. In the new window that should pop up, click "Next", then 
    "I Agree". Make sure the radio button next to "Just Me" is selected, then
    click "Next".

    You should now be given the option of choosing where the Anaconda distribution
    will be installed. The default should be fine (note if you happen to have a 
    folder which already has that name, an error will occur and you will be prompted
    to change the name). You then click "Next".

    Leave the first checkbox unchecked. Check the second checkbox which registers
    Anaconda as the default python program (you can read the benefits). Click
    "Install". This will take a while and you cannot stop the installation once 
    it is started. Then grab a Viennese coffee or Earl Grey tea (no substitutions).
