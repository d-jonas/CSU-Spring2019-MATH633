  - Installing Anaconda and Pytorch -
########################################

Tested on Windows and Linux. Need volunteer for macOS.

----------Anaconda-------------------------------
First we must install the Anaconda Distribution. This is available for 
Windows, macOS, and Linux. Since Python 2 no longer is being supported and is
considered legacy, we will install the Python 3 version of Anaconda.

Step 1: Navigating to the Website and Clicking Things

    Copy and paste the following URL into your browser's address bar:
    https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section

    When the page loads you should see a "Download" button under text reading 
    "Python 3.7 version". Click on this download button.

    An executable named something like "Anaconda3-5.3.1-Windows-x86_64.exe" should
    be downloaded (the name and extension will be slightly different for MacOS and
    Linux, but will begin with "Anaconda3"). This is the installer we will use in 
    the next step.

Step 2: Running the Installer

    Run the installer. In the new window that should pop up, click "Next", then 
    "I Agree". Make sure the radio button next to "Just Me" is selected, then
    click "Next".

    You should now be given the option of choosing where the Anaconda distribution
    will be installed. The default should be fine (note if you happen to have a 
    folder which already has that name, an error will occur and you will be prompted
    to change the name). You then click "Next".

    Leave the first checkbox unchecked. Check the second checkbox which registers
    Anaconda as the default python program (you can read the benefits). Click
    "Install". This will take a while and you cannot stop the installation once 
    it is started. Then grab a Viennese coffee or Earl Grey tea (no substitutions).
    
    Skip the installation of Visual Code (unless you want to use it as your IDE,
    I've heard good things about it but never used it).
    
Step 3: Learning More and Installing Packages

    Leave the two checkboxes checked (the second one is the most relevant for the 
    class) and click "Finish". Your browser will open with the Anaconda 
    Documentation site. There are instructions for Navigating to the various tools
    provided in your Anaconda installation for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
    
    Note that there is also a section on Conda in the dropdown table of contents
    to the left of the page. Conda is the tool you use when installing packages, 
    so this is definitely worth looking at, especially:
    https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html
    which shows, among other things, how to install Python packages.
    
    If you need to install a Python package, then open the Conda program (find
    how to at
    https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html#starting-conda
    which provides instructions for Windows, macOS, and Linux).
    Type "conda install packagename" (without quotes) to begin installing. You 
    will have to agree to the installation of packages after Conda figures out 
    what to do about dependencies.
    
    Sometimes you will have to use conda-forge which is the community supported set
    of packages. For an example of this installing tensorflow, see
    https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/tensorflow
    
-------------------------------------------------
----------Pytorch--------------------------------
The following instructions will add the Pytorch package to your Anaconda package set.
This is better than installing Pytorch through the pip installer for Python because
Anaconda will ensure Pytorch interacts nicely with all the other packages installed.

Step 1) Open the Anaconda Prompt (if you search for the program on your computer, it 
        should show up).

Step 2) Type one of the following without the quotes: 
        Windows: "conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=9.0 -c pytorch" 
        Linux: "conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=9.0 -c pytorch"
        macOS: "conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch"
               (macOS Binaries dont support CUDA so more instruction will be needed if
               CUDA is required)

Step 3) When prompted, accept the changes to be made. The installation should not take 
        more than a minute or two.
        
To use the Pytorch package in your Python code, include a line with "import torch" at
the top of your code along with the other import statements.
